# Pokémon Blackjack

## Project Scope

### Project description:
The latest and greatest Pokémon battle has arrived! This app should be a Blackjack style
card game between two Pokémon characters. Using the PokéAPI and the Deck of Cards
API, have two two randomly generated characters play a game of black jack and the winner
evolves!

### Requirements:
 -[ ] Uses the PokéAPI and the Deck of Cards API
 -[ ] User operates both characters (ie. clicks buttons to generate next card, stay, etc)
 -[ ] Ensure both characters are able to evolve, you may need to be specific about this in your query
 -[ ] Game should be keyboard operable
 -[ ] Display a visual indicator of who won, and what evolution they experienced
 -[ ] Proper error handling. For example:
    -[ ] Common error responses should be handled

### Stretch goals:
 -[ ] Dealer mode where operator is the dealer playing against 2 Pokémon
 -[ ] Animation for winning pokemon

### Deliverables:
 -[ ] Project files up on GitHub
 -[ ] Project up on GitHub pages or your own URL
 -[ ] All requirements completed BEFORE any stretch goals have been attempted


## Project 6 (agency-style group React application)

### Requirements:

 -[ ] Uses React, and no jQuery
 -[ ] Uses flexbox or grid where appropriate
 -[ ] Uses Axios and/or Firebase
 -[ ] Every group member has at least one significant commit on GitHub
 -[ ] React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs! don't use vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM! .setState() is always used to alter state!)
 -[ ] App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop down menu, search field)
 -[ ] It is clear to the user what the app does
 -[ ] App and interactions are accessible
 -[ ] Errors are handled effectively
 -[ ] Site is live on student's own URL or GitHub Pages

### Best Practices:
 -[ ] Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
 -[ ] Semantic HTML elements are used properly
 -[ ] Setup snippet is used
 -[ ] Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
 -[ ] Site is responsive and uses media queries
